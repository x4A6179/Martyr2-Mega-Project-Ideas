# Welcome to my take on [Martyr2's Project List](https://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/78802-martyr2s-mega-project-ideas-list/)

## Plan:
I plan on doing a handful of these projects to build up my experience.
A lot of these will be networking & web-based since I'm most interested in cybersecurity but there will be also some others for general practice/improvement
See the following sections for the projects I've done (or will be doing).

### Networking:
- Port Scanner (WIP)
- Small Web Server (Not Started)
- Packet Sniffer (WIP)
- Whois Search Tool (Not Started)

### Web-Based:
- Page Scraper (Not Started)
- Password Checker (WIP)
- Automated Login/Scheduled Login (Not Started)
