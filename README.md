# Welcome to my take on [Martyr2's Project List](https://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/78802-martyr2s-mega-project-ideas-list/)

### Plan:
I plan on doing a handful of these projects to build up my experience.
A lot of these will be networking & web-based since I'm most interested in cybersecurity but there will be also some others for general practice/improvement
See the following sections for the projects I've done (or will be doing).

### Networking:
- Port Scanner
- Small Web Server
- Packet Sniffer
- Whois Search Tool

### Web-Based:
- Page Scraper
- Password Checker
- Automated Login/Scheduled Login
